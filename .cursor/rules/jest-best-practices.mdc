- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test cases
- Use clear and descriptive names for test variables (inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX)
- Write unit tests for each public function in controllers and services
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies in unit tests
- Implement acceptance tests for each module using the Given-When-Then convention
- Write end-to-end tests for each API module
- Use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate dependencies
- Implement proper test coverage and aim for high coverage percentages
