description: Guidelines for optimizing MongoDB performance and queries
globs: **/*.{ts,js}

- Regularly analyze query performance using MongoDB's explain() to ensure indexes are used effectively
- Create appropriate single-field, compound, and text indexes on frequently queried attributes
- Use the .lean() method in Mongoose queries when full document functionality is not required
- Implement efficient pagination strategies (e.g., range queries or cursor-based pagination) for large datasets
- Leverage aggregation pipelines for complex data transformations and to reduce client-side processing
- Optimize bulk write operations to handle large volumes of data efficiently
- Periodically review and refactor queries to eliminate redundant data retrieval and reduce payload sizes
- Monitor database performance and adjust indexing strategies as your application evolves and data volume grows
