- Use modular architecture to organize your application
- Encapsulate API logic within modules, one per main domain/route
- Use DTOs with class-validator for input validation
- Implement MikroORM entities for data persistence
- Separate business logic and persistence in services
- Use global filters, middlewares, guards, and interceptors in a core module
- Create a shared module for utilities and shared business logic
- Write unit tests for controllers and services using Jest
- Implement end-to-end tests for each API module
- Add a test method to each controller for smoke testing
