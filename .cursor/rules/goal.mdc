Key Success Factors
Quality of Embeddings: The effectiveness of vector search depends heavily on the quality of embeddings. Invest time in creating comprehensive property descriptions and using the best available embedding models.
Prompt Engineering: Well-crafted prompts are essential for effective LLM utilization. Iterate on prompts based on performance and user feedback.
State Management: Proper state management in LangGraphJS is crucial for maintaining context across nodes and handling complex conversations.
Location Intelligence: For property search, location is often the most important factor. Invest in robust location services integration and proximity calculations.
User Experience: Focus on response quality, latency, and natural conversation flow. The system should feel like talking to a knowledgeable real estate agent, not an AI.
