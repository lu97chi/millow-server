- Use connection pooling and properly configured connection strings for optimal performance
- Enable authentication and enforce encryption for data security (both in transit and at rest)
- Deploy replica sets and sharding to ensure high availability and horizontal scalability
- Regularly back up data and perform recovery drills to ensure business continuity
- Monitor performance metrics using built-in profiling tools or third-party services and set alerts for slow queries or outages
- Design schemas to balance flexibility with performance, avoiding overly nested or unbounded documents
- Implement data archival strategies to manage large collections and maintain optimal performance
